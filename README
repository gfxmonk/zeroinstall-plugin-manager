This program is intended to be used as a <runner> for another
zero install feed, e.g:

<command name="run">
	<runner interface="http://gfxmonk.net/dist/0install/zeroinstall-plugin-manager.xml">
		<arg>http://example.com/your-feed.xml</arg>
	</runner>
</command>
<command name="core" path="my-program-executable"/>

It manages a user-specific list of feed URIs ("plugins"), and
launches the desired URL with those URIs as additional
dependencies.

For command-line options, run with --plugin-help
